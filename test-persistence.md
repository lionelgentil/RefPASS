# Data Persistence Test Guide

## Problem Fixed
The Soccer Referee App was not properly saving matchday data to the server. Changes made to matches, player check-ins, scores, and match status were being lost when the app was restarted or when multiple devices were used.

## What Was Fixed

### 1. **Immediate Server Uploads**
- All matchday operations now immediately upload to the server
- Added proper error handling and success confirmation
- Added detailed logging for debugging

### 2. **Consistent Data Saving**
- `addMatchDay()` - Now saves immediately with success feedback
- `removeMatchDay()` - Now saves immediately with success feedback  
- `updateMatchDay()` - Now saves immediately with success feedback
- `addMatchToMatchDay()` - Now saves immediately with success feedback
- `togglePlayerPresenceForMatch()` - Now saves immediately with success feedback
- `updateMatchScore()` - Now saves immediately with success feedback
- `updateMatchStatus()` - Now saves immediately with success feedback
- `updateMatchPresence()` - Now saves immediately with success feedback

### 3. **UI Updates**
- All operations now trigger immediate UI updates via `objectWillChange.send()`
- Users get immediate visual feedback when operations complete
- Sync status shows success/failure messages

### 4. **Server Logging**
- Enhanced server logging to show detailed information about saved data
- Easy to debug what's being saved and when

## How to Test

### 1. Start the Server
```bash
cd SoccerRefereeApp
npm start
```

### 2. Test Match Day Creation
1. Open the app
2. Go to "Match Days" tab
3. Tap "+" to add a new match day
4. Fill in details and save
5. **Check server console** - should see detailed logging
6. **Check file**: `SoccerRefereeApp/server-data/matchdays.json` should contain the new match day

### 3. Test Match Creation
1. Open a match day
2. Tap "+" to add a match
3. Select teams, time, and field
4. Save the match
5. **Check server console** - should see match day update
6. **Check file**: The JSON file should now contain the new match

### 4. Test Player Check-ins
1. Open a match
2. Check in some players for both teams
3. **Check server console** - should see updates for each check-in
4. **Check file**: The match should show updated `homeTeamPresentPlayers` and `awayTeamPresentPlayers`

### 5. Test Score Entry
1. Start a match (change status to "In Progress")
2. Enter a score
3. **Check server console** - should see score update
4. **Check file**: The match should show the scores and status change

### 6. Test Multi-Device Sync
1. Run the app on multiple simulators/devices
2. Make changes on one device
3. Wait 30 seconds (or force refresh in Settings)
4. Changes should appear on all devices

## Key Files Modified

### iOS App (`ContentView.swift`)
- Enhanced all matchday-related functions with immediate server uploads
- Added proper error handling and user feedback
- Added immediate UI updates

### Server (`server.js`)
- Enhanced logging for matchday operations
- Better debugging information

## Expected Behavior

✅ **Before Fix**: Changes were lost, no server persistence
✅ **After Fix**: All changes immediately saved to server with confirmation

The app now maintains state properly across:
- App restarts
- Multiple devices
- Network interruptions (with proper error handling)
- Real-time collaboration scenarios

## Verification

Check the `matchdays.json` file after each operation - it should immediately reflect your changes with proper timestamps and all data intact.
